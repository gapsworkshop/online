Several well-known beyond-birthday-bound PRFs are built by XORing outputs of permutations. In this talk, I will describe some of the main ideas used in recent Fourier-analytic tight security proofs of such PRFs. I will then discuss some open problems in the application of Fourier analysis in provable security of symmetric-key primitives.
